# Hackintosh-L340
Completed EFI for Lenovo l340.

Couldn't upload Microsoft folder so use yours. VoodooI2C kext are zipped, couldn't upload a whole kext (bigger than 100 files)

So if you are here, you must have Lenovo l340 Laptop. 
My config:
-i5-9300h
-16gb ram
-GTX 1650
-!touchpad ELAN0626
-Intel Wifi (I don't have a need changing to BCM)
